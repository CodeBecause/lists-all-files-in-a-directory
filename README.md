# lists-all-files-in-a-directory
This script lists all files in a directory
This script sets a directory path, uses the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to retrieve a list of all files in the directory, and then displays the list of files using a 
foreach loop and the Write-Host cmdlet. You can save this script as a .ps1 file and then run it in a PowerShell console by typing the file path and name.
